# Mateusz Zarebski - Portfolio
Hi! I'm Mateusz.  
I enjoy solving real-world problems using both deep learning and classical machine learning techniques.
My main passion lies in **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and computer vision, but I am also very interested in evolutionary algorithms, game AI, reinforcement learning, and other optimization methods.
I love exploring how AI - whether deep neural networks or traditional algorithms - can deliver tangible, practical value.
Additionally, I am deeply interested in video games, game mechanics, player behavior analysis, and AI-driven game systems (ludology).
